# Rings of Power

Dynamic web site that simulates a battle between the army of the Goods and of the Bads, based in Rings of Power.

This is a intermediate exercise of the second of Adalab.

## Technologies used

HTML, SASS, Vanilla JS and Adalab Web Starter Kit.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to create the `node_modules` folder. Use it locally with `npm start`.

## How to play

The user can choose a creature to play. It depends on the strength, it will fight with a random army generated for the machine for the control over the Middle Earth.

There are 10 rounds, the side with the highest score after that, wins and the game restarts.

Good luck!
